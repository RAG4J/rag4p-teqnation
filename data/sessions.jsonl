Simply combining off-the-shelf ingredients like language models and retrieval tools is akin to a home cook attempting a Michelin-starred meal - disastrous results are likely.We recognized that building truly robust, enterprise-grade AI assistants requires deep expertise spanning AI, systems infrastructure, security, and software engineering. Our Automind platform is founded on sophisticated technical insights that integrate classic computer science with modern large language models.Informed by decades of experience at companies like Microsoft and Meta, the Automind platform prioritizes enterprise requirements like security, reliability, and scalability. Our AI agents run as concurrent, fault-tolerant actors with persistent memory and hot-swappable models. Dynamic guardrails and access controls ensure data privacy and safe model behavior.State-of-the-art AI components like intelligent routing, semantic indexing, and local re-ranking produce accurate, trustworthy results. Infinite memory lets users refer back to past conversations. Careful lineage tracking enables citation, auditing, and compliance.A no-code workflow instruction paradigm allows anyone to train custom assistants through simple annotations, without programming. These assistants can then generalize to solve new problems. Leveraging techniques from compilers, Automind can even automatically fine-tune and deploy custom models per enterprise, team, or individual.In this talk, we introduce Automind and share the key insights that transformed a seemingly simple task into a formidable technical challenge - and how we overcame it.\"It is unbecoming for accomplished individuals to expend valuable time on tasks that could be efficiently handled by machines or delegated to others.\"Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716)", "room": "Perserij", "time": "Wed 09:40 - 10:05", "tags": ["Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning", "Introductory and overview", "Kotlin"]}

{"speakers": ["Kenny Baas-Schwegler", "Bruno Boucard"], "title": "Deep Dive into Model-Driven Design: Refining Domain Models in Code", "description": "Most software products begin with an initial software model, one that is typically naive and superficial, grounded in basic understanding. This initial phase is natural, as it aligns with the early stages of discovering and exploring a new product with stakeholders. Initially, the process involves identifying nouns and verbs to create the first objects and methods in our code. While this early model enables quick feedback for the product, it often becomes less effective over time. As more feedback is gathered, the model usually fails to accurately reflect the main concerns of domain experts, becoming less relevant for the product's development. The absence of a model that mirrors the domain's core aspects can prevent adjustments to the code based on changing stakeholder needs, potentially blocking product innovations. Additionally, the gap between the code and the domain model leads to missed opportunities for insights, as the code no longer represents our domain knowledge accurately.Join us in this live coding talk session focused on the significance of continuously refining your core domain models in code. We will introduce you to the context by guiding you through several collaborative modelling techniques such as Eventstorming, Domain Storytelling, Context Mapping, CRC-cards and more.

AI-native databases are designed to empower builders and developers to build AI-powered tools.We'll talk about how they enable better search, integrate with generative AI models, and improve generative models' capabilities. We'll also talk about the key pieces of technology that enable these value-adds, like vector indexes, vector and hybrid search, retrieval augmented generation, and multi-tenancy. Of course, there'll be live demos and examples to round out the talk, too.So join us to learn why an AI-native database should be an integral part of your AI tech stack.", "room": "Douchelokaal", "time": "Wed 15:45 - 16:30", "tags": ["Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning", "Intermediate", "No specific coding language"]}
{"speakers": ["Rens van de Schoot"], "title": "Using AI to save time and sanity", "description": "In today's academic world, the number of scientific papers on any topic is growing. While this wealth of textual data is a treasure trove for data scientists, it simultaneously presents significant challenges for anyone who wants to screen this literature systematically. Whether for medical guidelines, review papers, or for evidence-based policy recommendations, one needs to systematically sift through thousands of studies to identify the rare relevant ones. This tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone process (e.g., due to screening fatigue) usually demands months of work. Despite this effort, systematic overviews are indispensable for scholars and clinicians, policymakers, journalists, and the public at large. The rapidly evolving field of AI offers promising solutions to the literature screening challenge using machine learning models and, very recently, large language models (LLMs). However, many of these AI-driven solutions emerge from tech companies that publish new and, hopefully, better models at an unprecedented rate. The rapidity of advancements in the field of AI outpaces meticulous scientific evaluations, leaving many methods unrefined and unproven. Moreover, we know that the broader scientific community (and beyond) has concerns about using LLMs for research: Should we replace human screeners with an AI (as predicted by OpenAI), or should we keep a human in the loop? And, if we want to use an AI, what model is best for maximizing performance and under what conditions? How do humans interact with machines, and what types of bias are introduced by these new workflows?At The AI-aided knowledge discovery lab at Utrecht University, we facilitate research to answer such questions and develop fully open and transparent infrastructure to test and apply new models to real-world applications, including the open-source software ASReview (https://github.com/asreview). During the presentation, Rens will present several use cases where comprehensive literature overviews are essential (think of medical guidelines, side-effects of drugs, and dosage recommendations for children). He will show how machine learning models can accelerate the screening task, and then we will discuss whether AI can fully replace humans for this task…p.s., Become a stargazer of the ASReview project and help us to increase visibility!", "room": "Postkamer", "time": "Wed 15:45 - 16:30", "tags": ["Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning", "Intermediate"]}
{"speakers": ["Guus Klinkenberg"], "title": "From Puzzles to Proficiency: The Opportunities of Coding Competitions", "description": "For as long as we know, we have been competing. Arenas were built by the Romans to compete. Put to two kids in a room with just a stone, and they will start a completion about the silliest thing they can do with that stone. Humans are inherently competitive. However, the work we do is mostly about market outcome, and the outcome is not entirely based on skills or how good we are at using our tools. Programming competitions like Advent of Code or hackathons are a nice environment to experiment with tools and technologies while gaining new or improving skills and insights. And at the same time, you connect with colleagues or new people.In this talk, we first dive into why these competitions can be fun, and how we can benefit from events like this. Next, we look into my experience while organizing various programming competitions. This will include some examples, takeaways and maybe a blunder or two, which will help you participate or organize a competition!", "room": "Kalvermelk 1", "time": "Wed 16:00 - 16:15", "tags": ["People & Culture", "Geeky & Fun", "Introductory and overview", "No specific coding language"]}

{"speakers": ["Martin Förtsch", "Thomas Endres", "Jonas Mayer"], "title": "The Shitposting AI - An Ironic Solution to Fruitless Online Debate", "description": "Using modern AI approaches such as GPT-2, Tacotron and Conformers, we created fully autonomous robot heads that engage in heated social media discussions, completely taking the human out of the loop. The TNG Innovation Hacking Team created a prototype of an end-to-end natural language understanding system, employing techniques such as Speech-to-Text (STT), Conditional Text Generation and Text-To-Speech (TTS).Social media comments have become the predominant medium for public discussion. However, discussions on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit are notorious for their poor debate culture and missing conclusiveness. The obvious solution to this tremendous waste of time is automation of such fruitless discussions using a bot. In this talk, we will give an introduction to NLP, focussing on the concepts of STT, Text Generation and TTS. Using live demos, we will guide you through the process of scraping social media comments, training a text generation model, synthesizing millions of voices and building IoT robot heads.", "room": "Perserij", "time": "Wed 16:45 - 17:30", "tags": ["Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning", "People & Culture", "Geeky & Fun", "Introductory and overview", "No specific coding language"]}
